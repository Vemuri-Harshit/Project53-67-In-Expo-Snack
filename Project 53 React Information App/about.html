       <h2>What is React Native?</h2>   
       
       <p>Engineers at Facebook, while working on designing the different complex Facebook apps,
        realized that the declarative style of coding would make their app organization easy.<br>

        They developed a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development
        framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way.<br>

        JSX combines both HTML and Javascript style of coding. JSX is declarative - we tell what are
        the different components we want in the application.<br>

        We can write JSX and React Native code in an online editor called 'snack'.<br>

        'Snack' is an online editor written by Expo, which allows us to write and compile React
        Native code in an online environment. We can also preview the output of the code using
        Snack.<br>

      <p>As you can see,In the above image <br><br>
        1.On the left side,all the files in the project.<br>
        2.At the centrethe workspace where we will write our code.<br>
        3.On the right side,the output of your code.<br><br>

        You can see the output for either Android, iOS or Web
