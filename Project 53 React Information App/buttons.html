      <p>  Let's import Button instead of Text from react native library.We can use the Button JSX tag to get a button component.<br><br>

    Button has a property called ‘title’ which can be used to display text inside the button.<br>
    You can see that there is a Button at the top of the app. It is half-hidden by the top<br>
    notification bar of the phone.<br>

Unfortunately, the button does not have a style property defined on it.<br>
Instead, we will use ‘View Component’ and place Button inside it.We can then adjust the style of ‘View Component’.<br><br>

‘View Component’ is simply an empty container - just like ‘div’ in HTML.<br>
It has a style property defined on it.<br><br>

Let's import ‘View Component’.
Let's place the button inside the ‘View Component’ and add style to it so that the button is
at the bottom.

Button has another property called ‘color’ defined on it. You can use it to set a different color
to the button. You can also use Hexadecimal numbers.
