        <h2>What are Components and Functions?</h2> 
        
        <p>To write code in JSX or React Native, we first need to the basic components and functions required</p>
        
        <h3>Components</h3>

        <p>
            A Component is a baseclass and all React components are inherited from this baseclass
            Component.<br><br>

            Component class is defined in the React library. You can see how React and Component
            library is imported from the React library in line 1.<br><br>

            To write code we need a few components like text and button which are imported from the rect-native library.<br>
            All the components that you need must be imported from either your own library or from the react library
        </p>

        <p>In line 10 you can see how a new Class called App extends the Component class. <br><br>

            App itself is a React Native Component. All React Native components must live inside the
            APP COMPONENT.<br><br>

            A few basic Coponents are:-
            </p>

        <a href = "text.html"><h3>Text</h3></a>
        <a href= "buttons.html"><h3>Button</h3></a>
        
        <h2>Functions</h2>

        <p>We basically have only 1 function which is render(which also uses return() )</p>

        <a href = "render and return.html"><h3>Render</h3></a>
