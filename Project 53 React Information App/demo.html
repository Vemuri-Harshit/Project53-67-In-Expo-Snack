            In the first two lines we imported all the components that we need for the code.<br><br>

            From lines 4-15, we made our own class named GreenButton which extends the components.<br><br>
            
            Though there is only one component coders always put them in view tag even though render would accept the one component.<br>
            The Button tag is given title and color through the properties and the {''} is just for giving a title but it wouldn't make a difference if it wasn't there.<br><br>

            Then we closed all the tags and made our own class which makes a green button when called..<br><br><br>

            We then called the app class with render and return and as there are more than one components we used the view tag to contain them.<br>
            The view tag is give a styling of a margin from the top 30 pixels, which makes all the components within it start after 30 pixels.<br>
            Then we put text on the screen and called the green button which was made by our class,and closed it(It is a self-closing tag).

            And we made our very own first app in JSX.
