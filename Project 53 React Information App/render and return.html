        <p>
             You can see that there is only one defined function inside the App Class - it is called render();<br>
            ‘render()’ function simply displays whatever components are returned by it.<br><br>

            Here, you can see that the Text component is returned. So, the Text component gets displayed on the screen.<br><br>

            Notice that all the code in the file is Javascript except the code inside render. This is JSX. It<br>
            contains tags which correspond to React Components.<br><br>

            We can write Javascript inside JSX using { } 'curly brackets'<br><br>
            
            "style" property takes a json object {}.<br><br>

            When we are rendering components using JSX tags (Text), we can execute
            Javascript inside the {}.<br>
            You see two {{ }} because one {} says that we are going to write javascript code. The other {}
            is for the json object.<br><br>

            Also, we write CSS properties in React Native in camel case (marginTop instead of
            margin-top)
                  
            Return Tag just return all the components in The view.<br><br>
            
            BTW,Render does not accept more than one component so we use view tag as it can contain infinite components,so itis like a medium between render and the components.<br>
