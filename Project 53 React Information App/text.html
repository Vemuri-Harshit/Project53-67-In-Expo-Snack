          The text  tag which you see is such a React component. This component allows you to
        write text on the screen.<br><br>

        Text is a component which is already defined in a library called React Native.<br><br>

        In line 2, you can see how we are importing the component Text from React Native Library.<br>
        Note: When compared to HTML tags which start with lowercase letters, React native
        components start with uppercase.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also see that the Text component has a style 'property' defined on it. Just like html
        tags have some properties defined on them.<br><br>
        (For example: The Image tag has src, width, height etc.)
        "style" property takes a json object {}.<br><br>

        In the style property we simply add CSS code to make our code look more appealing.<br>
        For example: we add marging or padding to give spaces between the texts.
